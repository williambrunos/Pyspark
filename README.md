# Oh hi, there!

## Focus of this repository

This repository focus on pyspark studies using:

'Learning Spark, Second Edition' - O'Reilly
'Spark: showing the tool' - Alura

## Why pyspark

Well, spark is almost the definitive tool for dealing with large amounts of data, allowing us to perform complex computing using distributed programming over clusters. Also, we use python because...it's python :p

## What will we develop

- We are going to understand how to scale our data processing over the clusters using pyspark.
- Perform real complex ML models using ``MLlib``
- Howw to deploy and manaege models using ``MLflow``

## For whom is this course

- Data Scientists
- ML engineers
- Data engineers
- All the curious people

## How this repo is organized

Well, this repo is built to store some contents based on the book, but it can have something extra according to my studies. However, in general we have:

### Chapter 1 - Introduction to Apache Spark: A Unified Analytics Engine

Evolution of big data and a high level overview of Apache Spark.

### Chapter 2 - Downloading Apache Spark and Getting Started

Downloading and setting apache spark local.

### Chapter 3 - 6 - Apache Spark structured APIs, SQL and Dataframes

Ingest data from built-in and external data sources, built-in and custom functions, utilize spark SQL.

### Chapter 7 - Optimizing and Tunning Spark Applications

Best practices for tuning, optimizing, debugging and inspecting spark applications.

### Chapter 8 - Structured Streaming

Stateful aggregations, streaming queries.

### Chapter 9 - Building Reliable Data Lakes with Apache Spark

### Chapter 10 - Machine Learning with MLlib

Introduces MLlib, the distributed ML library for Spark, ML pipeline and feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, saving and loading models.

### Chapter 11 - Managing, Deploying and Scaling ML pipelines with Apache Spark

All these using MLflow

## Dev environment
